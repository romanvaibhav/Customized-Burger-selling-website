In a world where customization is key, this online burger-selling website seeks 
to redefine the way customers enjoy their favorite fast food. Traditional 
customization options often limit users to pre-designed combinations of 
ingredients. 
However, our platform breaks these constraints by allowing customers not 
only to modify existing burger options but also to design entirely new burgers 
from the ground up. With a vast array of fresh and premium ingredients at 
their disposal, users can unleash their creativity and tailor their burgers to suit 
their unique preferences
